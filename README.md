![Sangeet Mixtapes](sangeet_image.jpg)
> Automatically generate mixtapes for your sangeet songs

## About
Solves the painstaking task of ripping, concatenating, and mixing songs from Youtube.

1. Takes in a spreadsheet with all the songs, with their start and stop times along with how you want them faded in and
out.
2. All songs under the same act and scene will be combined into a single song.
3. Will download from youtube, extract out the best possible audio quality and will trim, fade in/out, concatenate and
rename the songs accordingly.

Under the hood it primarily devolves to `youtube-dl` and `ffmpeg` for all the heavy-lifting. `sangeet.js` takes a
batteries-included, sane-defaults, best quality (ymmv) approach to dealing with the crazy number of codecs that youtube
runs.
In the process, I ended up learning a lot about ffmpeg (amazing tool!) and life.

2. Intelligence Caching® - Each run will only download unseen Youtube songs.
3. Impress your

realtime audio mixtape generation
